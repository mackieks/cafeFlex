D Voltage Detector with Fixed Delay Time: ROHM's BD45xxxG and BD46xxxG series of reset ICs utilize CMOS processes for low current consumption and high accuracy. The built-in counter timer delay circuit eliminates the need to set the delay time via external capacitor. The extensive lineup includes both Nch Open Drain and CMOS output types in a wide range of detection voltages (from 2.3V to 4.8V, in 0.1V steps), enabling selection of the ideal solution based on customer requirements. A total of 156 models are o
